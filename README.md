# Code Clause Task 2 - Object Detection using Pre-trained YOLO Model

This project demonstrates object detection using a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The model is capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image. This project uses Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the necessary libraries and download the YOLO model files. This can be done directly in a Google Colab notebook.

### Libraries

The following libraries are required:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
